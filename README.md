# Plain English Contributor License Agreement

a plain-language contributor license agreement for company- or foundation-stewarded open software projects

This is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English.  If something doesn't make sense, that's the form's fault, not yours.  Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/plain-english-contributor-license-agreement/issues/new) so we can fix it.

## Be Warned!

***License agreements are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for a project, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions.  They may decide this form fits your needs.***

***Do _not_ put confidential information about you or your work in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.***

## Building

With Docker installed, you can build `.docx` and `.pdf` copies of the CLA by running `make docker`.
